NATURF: Neighborhood Adaptive Tissues for Urban Resilience Futures

## Description

NATURF was created to:

  - addresses the knowledge gap of the effect of the geometry of a neighborhood on the local meteorology and
  -  translate neighborhood morphology (building footprints, heights, spacing, etc.) representations to the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF)-readable urban parameters so that meteorological processes at urban scale can interact with the built environment.

## Workflow

1. Download example data:  [Example Data](www.google.com)
2. Setup paths and settings in `scripts/workflow.py`
3. Run `scripts/workflow.py` in a Python 3.8 or greater environment
