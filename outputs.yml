frontal_area_density:
  equation_number: 14
  formula: \frac{\text{frontal_area}}{\text{building_plan_area}}
  # TODO: should we list units as .NAN or an empty string?
  long_description: >
    The frontal area of a building at a certain height increment
    divided by the building plan area. naturf calculates frontal
    area density from the four cardinal directions (east, north,
    west, south) and at 5 meter increments from ground level to
    75 meters. Parameters 1-15 represent the north, paramters
    16-30 represent the west, parameters 31-45 represent the south,
    and parameters 46-60 represent the east."

plan_area_density:
  equation_number: 7
  formula: \frac{\text{building_footprint_area}}{\text{total_lot_area}}
  long_description: >
    The ratio of building footprint areas within the building
    plan area to the entire building plan area, calculated in
    5 meter increments from ground level to 75 meters. naturf
    projects the building footprint vertically to the building
    height, meaning plan area density is the same at every
    vertical level.

  long_description: >
    The ratio of building rooftop area to the building plan area,
    calculated in 5 meter increments from ground level to 75
    meters. Because naturf projects building footprints vertically
    to the building height, these parameters are equal to the
    plan area density.

    area to the entire building plan area, calculated at ground
    level. For naturf, this is equal to plan area density at any
    height increment.

frontal_area_index:

  formula: \frac{\text{building_wall_length} \cdot \text{building_height}}{\text{average_alongwind_distance_between_building_centroids} \cdot \text{average_crosswind_distance_between_building_centroids}}
  long_description: >
    The ratio of the entire frontal area of a building to
    the building plan area. naturf calculates the frontal
    area index from the four cardinal directions. Because
    buildings often do not face a cardinal direction head
    on, naturf uses the average alongwind and crosswind
    distance from the current building centroid to all
    other building centroids for the building plan area.

  long_description: >
    The sum of the target building surface area and the
    exposed ground area divided by the total plan area.
    NATURF does not look at vegetation, so this is equal
    to the ratio of surface area to plan area.

    buildings in the current plan area.
