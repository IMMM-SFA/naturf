Data Requirements
-----------------

The only input data required for *naturf* is a shapefile with building footprints and height data. There should be a field with a unique ID for each building the shapefile, and it should be in a projected coordinate system such as Alber Equal Area Conic. For input to the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), the computed parameters for each building will be projected into WGS 84. Single neighborhoods can be processed in seconds to minutes, but larger datasets (e.g. city-scale) can take several days to process, and are best suited for HPC.

Fundamental equations and concepts
----------------------------------

Supporting Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following parameters/concepts are not output from **naturf** by default, but they contribute to the calculation of the output parameters.

Plan Area
^^^^^^^^^

When calculating parameters, **naturf** creates a buffer around each target building called the plan (or dilated) area. Each building has its own plan area which identifies neighbors to that target building which are important for the calculation of parameters. For the parameter definitions below, *total plan area* refers to the area of that buffer around the target building, while *building plan area* refers to the sum of building footprints within the *total plan area*. *Total plan area* should always be a larger value than the *building plan area*.

Frontal Length
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the urban parameters calculated by **naturf**, frontal length refers to the wall length perpendicular to a given direction for all buildings within the target building's total plan area.

Frontal Area
^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the urban parameters calculated by **naturf**, frontal area refers to the wall area perpendicular to a given direction for all buildings within the target building's total plan area.

Lot Area
^^^^^^^^

For the urban parameters calculated by **naturf**, lot area refers to the total surface area of all buildings
within a given building's total plan area divided by the number of buildings in the total plan area.

Building Height Limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following NUDAPT, **naturf** bins building heights into five meter increments from 0 to 75 meters. Any building with a height greater than 75 meters is considered as ending at 75 meters.

Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Frontal Area Density (1-60)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Frontal area density is the frontal area at a certain height increment divided by the total plan area. **naturf** calculates frontal area density from the four cardinal directions (east, north, west, south) and at 5 meter increments from ground level to 75 meters. Parameters 1-15 represent the north, parameters 16-30 represent the west, parameters 31-45 represent the south, and parameters 46-60 represent the east. For instance, parameter 1 gives the north-facing wall area for each building and its neighbors divided by the total plan area. [Burian2003]_ Eq. 14

.. math::
  FAD = \frac{FA}{TPA}

where `FAD` is Frontal area density; `FA` is the frontal area of the wall from the current direction and height level in :math:`m^2`; `TPA` is the total plan area in :math:`m^2`.

Plan Area Density (61-75)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plan area density is the ratio of building plan area to the total plan area, calculated in 5 meter increments from ground level to 75 meters. **naturf** projects the building footprint vertically to the building height, meaning plan area density is the same at every vertical level. [Burian2003]_ Eq. 7

.. math::
  PAD = \frac{BPA}{TPA}

where, `PAD` is the plan area density; `BPA` is the building plan area in :math:`m^2`; `TPA` is the total plan area in :math:`m^2`.

Rooftop Area Density (76-90)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rooftop area density is the ratio of building rooftop area to the total plan area, calculated in 5 meter increments from ground level to 75 meters. Because **naturf** projects building footprints vertically to the building height, these parameters are equal to the plan area density. [Burian2003]_ Eq. 7

Plan Area Fraction (91)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plan area fraction is the ratio of building plan area to the total plan area, calculated at ground level. For **naturf**, this is equal to plan area density at any height increment. [Burian2003]_ Eq. 4

Mean Building Height (92)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The average building height of all buildings within the total plan area.

Standard Deviation of Building Heights (93)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The standard deviation of building heights for all buildings within the total plan area.

Area Weighted Mean of Building Heights (94)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The average height of all buildings within the total plan area weighted by the total plan area. [Burian2003]_ Eq. 3

.. math::

  AWMH = \frac{\Sigma{A_i zh_i}}{\Sigma{A_i}}

where, `AWMH` is the area weighted mean height in m; `A_i` is the current building plan area in `m^2`; `zh_i` is the current building height in m.

Building Surface Area to Plan Area Ratio (95)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ratio of all the surface areas of a building to the total plan area. [Burian2003]_ Eq. 16

Frontal Area Index (96-99)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Frontal area index is the ratio of the entire frontal area of a building to the total plan area. **naturf** calculates the frontal area index from the four cardinal directions. Because buildings often do not face a cardinal direction head on, **naturf** uses the average alongwind and crosswind distance from the current building centroid to all other building centroids for the total plan area. [Burian2003]_ Eq. 12

.. math::
  FAI = \frac{FA}{TPA}

where, `FAI` is frontal area index; `FA` is the frontal area of the wall from the current direction in :math:`m^2`; `TPA` is the total plan area in :math:`m^2`.

Complete Aspect Ratio (100)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ratio of building surface area and exposed ground area to the total plan area. [Burian2003]_ Eq. 15

.. math::
  CAR = \frac{BSA + (PA - BPA)}{TPA}

where, `BSA` is the building surface area in :math:`m^2`; `BPA` is the building plan area in :math:`m^2`; `TPA` is the total plan area in :math:`m^2`.

Height-to-Width Ratio (101)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ratio of the building height to the street width. **naturf** generalizes this as the ratio of average height of buildings in the total plan area to average distance from the current building to all other buildings in the total plan area. If a building has no other buildings in its total plan area, the average distance is set to a default value. [Burian2003]_ Eq. 18

.. math::
  \overline{\lambda_s} = \frac{\overline{z_h}}{\overline{W}}

where, :math:`\overline{\lambda_s}` is the average height-to-width ratio; :math:`\overline{z_h}` is the average building height in m; :math:`\overline{W}` is the average distance between buildings.

Sky-View Factor (102)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The fraction of visible sky in a given area. **naturf** generalizes the distance between buildings to be the average distance between the current building and all other buildings in the total plan area.  [Dirksen2019]_ Eq. 1

.. math::
  SVF = cos(arctan(\frac{H}{0.5W}))

where, `SVF` is the sky-view factor; `H` is the building height in m; `W` is the distance between buildings in m.

where, `RRL` is the Raupach roughness length in m; `RDH` is the Raupach displacement height in m; :math:`\kappa` is von K치rm치n's constant = 0.4; `C_S` is the substrate-surface drag coefficient = 0.003; `C_R` is the roughness-element drag coefficient = 0.3; :math:`\lambda` is the frontal area index; :math:`\Psi_h` is the roughness-sublayer influence function = 0.193.

Vertical Distribution of Building Heights (118-132)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
